			<h4>The Maze Runner</h4>
			<p>Based off the first book of a young adult trilogy written by James Dashner. The novel was originally published on October 6, 2009. Thomas, the main character, arrives at the glade. The glade is where all the boys live. There is gigantic maze surrounding the glade. Every morning the doors to the maze open and the boys send runners into the maze to try and find a way out. In the evening the doors close and the grievers roam the maze. Grievers are ferocious mechanical creatures that kill whatever stays in the maze overnight. Thomas, ends up pushing the limits of the glade community and ultimately finds a way out of the maze â€“ at the cost of much carnage. The movie ends with a tie in to a greater plot, that the maze is an experiment in a post-apocalyptic world. </p>
